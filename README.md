# #  Zumo Reflectance Sensor Array:
This reflectance sensor module is designed for use with the Zumo shield for Arduino. It has six IR LED/phototransistor pairs that can be used for line following or edge detection; each sensor provides an independent, digital I/O-measurable output. The array draws approximately 40 mA when the emitters are on, and an optional input allows the emitters to be turned off for additional sensing or power-saving options.


# # Micro Metal Gearmotor HP 6V:
This gearmotor is a miniature high-power, 6 V brushed DC motor with a 75.81:1 metal gearbox. It has a cross section of 10 × 12 mm, and the D-shaped gearbox output shaft is 9 mm long and 3 mm in diameter.

# # Pololu Carrier with Sharp GP2Y0D815Z0F Digital Distance Sensor 15cm:
This small digital distance sensor detects objects between 0.5 cm and 15 cm (0.2″ and 6″) away. With its quick response time, small size, low current draw, and short minimum sensing distance, this sensor is a good choice for non-contact, close-proximity object detection, and our compact carrier PCB makes it easy to integrate into your project.
